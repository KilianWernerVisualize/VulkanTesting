# VulkanTesting

This project realizes the tutorial on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ including MSAA, Texture Mapping and GPU-based on-the-fly Mip-Map generation.

I extended the tutorial code with distinct transfer and graphics queuefamilies, just to play around with explicit ownership transfer and synchronization.
Additionally I added normal handling and per fragment phong lighting for a single directional light.
